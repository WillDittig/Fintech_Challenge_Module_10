# Fintech_Challenge_Module_10
Assignment: You’ll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. You’ll then plot the results so that you can visually show the performance.
Libraries used in this project: Pandas, sklearn Kmeans, sklearn decomposition, sklearn preprocessing
This juptyr notebook uses the clustering method using the traditional and PCA method to determine the number of ideal clusters for cryptocurrencie data.
